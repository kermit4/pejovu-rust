This implements the https://github.com/kermit4/pejovu protocol.

This will make available any files in the directory ./pejovu  It will ignore any requests for anything that's not a sha256, so as long as Rust's JSON parser (Serde) doesn't have an exploit, it seems safe to leave running.

It currently assumes the filenames are their sha256 (maybe link them to their ordinary names for now)

For testing I have made available, on SSD and 200Mbps in Southern Europe,

their hashes are also at https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/SHA256SUMS

as other people get copies, you should see speeds improve.  Put some of these up https://publicdomainmovie.net/ maybe.

This is very early in development, so people can send you files you didn't request, or sabotage transfers by sending invalid data.  Contributors are welcome. 

To request a file, run with the sha256 as an arguement.  It will be placed in ./pejovu/incomplete/<sha256> until it is complete.

File sharing is a primitive example common use case, not the only intended purpose.

# TODO
- save peer list 
- chose random port on first run, but then stick with it on restarts
- save transfer state to resume transfers if the application is restarted
