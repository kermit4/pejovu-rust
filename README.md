This implements the https://github.com/kermit4/pejovu protocol.

This will make available any files in the directory ./pejovu  It will ignore any requests for anything that has a / or \ in it, so as long as Rust's JSON parser (Serde) doesn't have an exploit, it seems safe to leave running.

To request a file, run with the content_id as an arguement.  It will be placed in ./pejovu/incomplete/ until it is complete, then moved to ./pejovu

i.e. 

     ./target/debug/pejovu 3d5486b9e4dcd259689ebfd0563679990a4cf45cf83b7b7b5e99de5a46b5d46f  # abe_lincoln_of_the_4th_ave.mp4

File sharing is more of a primitave than a main purpose.  Things can build upon the ability to reliably and efficienty send more than what fits in one message.

# TODO
let p: Person = serde_json::from_str(data)?
- save peer list  between restarts to not depend on the hard coded list
- send_peers and bump_inbounds should chose more intelligently, randomly is better than first 50, ideally a vector sorted by responsiveness and chosen somewhat ranomly with a lean to the closer hosts
- chose random port on first run, but then stick with it between restarts, save in a config file json
- need sub-hashes otherwise a bad bit may copy aroundd and the file may never complete correctly anywhere
- some way to not be used as a DDOS as people can spoof their IPs in a request for peers or contont

maybe replies just include request and that it is a reply, so cookies and all data are there even if not used by replier
 
cookie as its own message.  be sure to call part timestamp too  so people dont cache it

timer to say hey and ask whatsup
